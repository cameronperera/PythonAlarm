# PythonAlarm
Alarm Clock written with Python 3.6

Alarm Clock script I wrote when my alarm clock app started acting up

This is my first Python project I have ever written so please keep that in mind.

You will need to install pyglet if you do not have it

Change SOUNDTEST variable to music you want played

Change vader_business.jpg in image = pyglet.resource.image('vader_business.jpg') to image you want to use

Change punch variable to whatever time you need

Be sure to update sleep seconds for each punch if you change them

Currently the alarm only goes off Mon-Fri

When it wakes up Saturday morning it immediately goes back to sleep for 2 days

Enjoy
