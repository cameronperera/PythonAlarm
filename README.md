# PythonAlarm
Alarm Clock written with Python 3.6

Updated Alarm Clock script I wrote using TDD and clean code practices

You can either use stored punch times or create new ones

The time the program sleeps is calculated by taking the current time and next punch time meaning you no longer have to adjust the sleep times manually

Currently the alarm only goes off Mon-Fri

When it wakes up Saturday morning it immediately goes back to sleep for 2 days

Enjoy
